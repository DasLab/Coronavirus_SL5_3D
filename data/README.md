# Data

The alpha- and betacoronavirus reference sequences trimmed to the SL5 domain can be found in [SL5_reference_sequences.fasta](SL5_reference_sequences.fasta) and the SL5 domains studied here can be found at [SL5_studied.fasta](SL5_studied.fasta).

1D SHAPE reacitivty was obtained from [Sun et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.008), the exact files used here are found in [Sun_icSHAPE/](Sun_icSHAPE).

The rdat files used in M2-seq data analysis can be found in [m2seq/](m2seq). These were produced from the sequencing data according to the methods described in the paper this repository accompanies,

The predicted models for the SARS-CoV-2 (R1149) and BtCoV-HKU5 (R1156) SL5 domains for CASP15 can be found on the CASP [website](https://predictioncenter.org/download_area/CASP15/predictions/RNA/), these predicted models be be found in [CASP_results/](CASP_results). Summary tables describing whether each model has correct junction base-pairing and stacking as calculated in [https://github.com/DasLab/CASP15_RNA_EM](https://github.com/DasLab/CASP15_RNA_EM) can also be found in this folder.

All the validation scores are found in [all_scores.csv](all_scores.csv) which is created in [graph_figures/ERRASER_Plots.ipynb](../graph_figures/ERRASER_Plots.ipynb) from validation completed in the [analysis/map_to_model](../analysis/map_to_model) folder.
